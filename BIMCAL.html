        <p class="PARA">
          The calculator automatically adjusts for metric or imperial units, so
          you don’t have to convert values manually.

      <h2 class="HEADING">What is BMI?</h2>
      <p class="PARA">
        The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple, yet powerful tool that helps
        you understand whether your body weight is healthy for your height. It
        is widely used by doctors, nutritionists, and fitness experts as a
        quick screening tool to identify potential weight-related health
        risks.
      </p>
      <p class="PARA">
        BMI is not a diagnostic tool, but it provides a first look at your
        general health status. It helps you know if you are underweight,
        within a normal range, overweight, or obese. By regularly checking
        your BMI, you can track changes over time and make informed decisions
        about your lifestyle, diet, and fitness routines.
      </p>
      <h2 class="HEADING">Historical Background of BMI</h2>
      <p class="PARA">
        The concept of BMI was first introduced in the
        <b>19th century by Adolphe Quetelet</b>, a Belgian mathematician and
        statistician. Initially called the <b>Quetelet Index</b>, it was
        designed to study population statistics and human growth patterns.
      </p>
      <p class="PARA">
        Over time, BMI became a <b>global standard</b> for health assessment
        because it is simple, reliable, and easy to compare across
        populations. Today, it is used in medical research, public health
        programs, and personal health tracking worldwide.
      </p>
      <h2 class="HEADING">Why is BMI Important?</h2>
      <p class="PARA">
        BMI is more than just a number. It’s a practical health indicator that
        helps you understand your body weight in relation to your overall
        well-being.
      </p>
      <div class="listtopics">
        <h3 class="SubHeading">1. Monitoring General Health</h3>
        <p class="PARA">
          A BMI in the normal range suggests a balanced weight. Deviations
          (too high or too low) can signal potential nutritional or health
          issues that may require attention.
        </p>
        <h3 class="SubHeading">2. Chronic Disease Risk</h3>
        <p class="PARA">
          A higher BMI is strongly linked with an increased risk of chronic
          conditions such as:
          <br />
          <span>→</span> Type 2 diabetes
          <br />
          <span>→</span> High blood pressure
          <br />
          <span>→</span> Heart disease
          <br />
          <span>→</span> Certain metabolic disorders
        </p>
        <h3 class="SubHeading">3. Fitness & Progress Tracking</h3>
        <p class="PARA">
          Regularly checking BMI allows you to monitor changes over time. This
          is particularly useful if you’re following a weight loss, muscle
          gain, or fitness program.
        </p>
        <h3 class="SubHeading">4. Lifestyle Guidance</h3>
        <p class="PARA">
          By understanding your BMI, you can make more informed decisions
          about:

          <br />
          <span>→</span> Nutrition and diet
