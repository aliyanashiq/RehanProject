        A fuel consumption calculator shows you in seconds how much fuel your
        car actually burns per kilometre or per trip and what that means in
        real costs.

        Here you’ll get:

      <h2 class="HEADING">How This Fuel Consumption Calculator Works</h2>
      <p class="PARA">
        Most online tools hide the formulas behind the calculator interface.
        Here are the transparent equations:
      </p>
      <div class="listtopics">
        <h3 class="SubHeading">Metric Formula (L/100 km)</h3>
        <span>L/100 km = (litres used ÷ kilometres driven) × 100</span>
        <p class="PARA">
          Divide the litres you poured in by the kilometres you just drove,
          then multiply by 100. The answer tells you how many litres your car
          needs to travel 100 kilometres.
        </p>
        <h3 class="SubHeading">Imperial Formula (MPG)</h3>
        <span>MPG = miles ÷ gallons</span>
        <p class="PARA">
          Divide the miles you drove by the gallons you added. The answer
          tells you how many miles your car can travel on one gallon of fuel.
        </p>
        <h3 class="SubHeading">Cost per Kilometre Formula</h3>
        <span>Cost/km = (litres used ÷ km) × price per litre</span>
        <p class="PARA">
          Divide litres by kilometres, then multiply by the price you paid per
          litre. The answer is the exact cost of driving one kilometre –
          perfect for splitting bills with friends or invoicing clients.
        </p>
        <h3 class="SubHeading">Example</h3>
        <p class="PARA">
          <span>→</span>Distance: 120 km
          <br />
          <span>→</span>Fuel used: 8.5 L
          <br />
          <span>→</span>Fuel price: 1.85 zł/L
        </p>
        <p class="PARA">
          Step 1: L/100 km = (8.5 ÷ 120) × 100 = <b>7.08 L/100 km</b>
          <br />
          Step 2: Total trip cost = 8.5 × 1.85 = <b>15.73 zł</b>
          <br />
          Step 3: Cost per km = 15.73 ÷ 120 = <b>0.13 zł/km</b>
          <br />
        </p>
        <p class="PARA">
          This calculation shows more than just numbers on a screen. It tells
          you that your car consumes about 7 litres of fuel per 100 km, which
          is a clear indicator of efficiency. At the same time, you see the
          true cost of your journey in this case, 15.73 zł for 120 km.
          Breaking it down further, each kilometre costs you 0.13 zł, a figure
          that can be very useful when planning your monthly fuel budget,
          splitting costs with passengers, or comparing the running expense of
          different cars.
